We had three exploits running during RuCTFE 2015. Our first exploit was bank where we actually just read the access.log which contained the flags. We fixed this flaw quickly and moved on without further investigation of the service. We scored quite some flags with this trivial exploit.
Our cashcow was hm where we exploited the fixed key in the auth token. During the game we missed the other flaws but were able to exploit many teams.
Our mol exploit was weaponized shortly before the game ended so we didn't score many flags.
